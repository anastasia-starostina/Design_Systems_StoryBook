# Design Systems with React and Storybook

Autumnal Design system built with React & Storybook. 

 Originally inspired by [@emmabostian](https://github.com/emmabostian)'s Frontend Masters course, the project started with the idea to design a system with a fall aesthetic that could fit an independent business, farmers market or an autumn funfair.

## Wireframes

Please view the react-storybook.fig file to see the pages with colour styles, typescale and button, textfiels and modal components. All primary colours of this design system are based on the image attached to the colours page. The colours were purposely chosen to communicate the semantics of the application and recreate the atmosphere of the season. The design language was developed with Accessibility, Colour and Typography principles in mind.
